## A Note on the Framework

This framework is shared freely because knowledge that could help humanity navigate the emergence of superintelligence should not be gatekept.

The Unified Star Framework itself demonstrates its own principle:

> *"Σ does not predict actions. It constrains trajectories."*

Sharing knowledge openly creates more coherent outcomes than hoarding it. The framework applies to itself.
